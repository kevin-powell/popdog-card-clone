## Building and Running

There are many ways to build and run this project. 1 suggestion is to use both the sass and http-server NPM commands.

### To install

```
npm i -g sass
npm i -g http-server
```

### Building

In 2 terminal windows:

```
# Terminal Window 1
sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.css

# Terminal Window 2
http-server .
```

### Running

When both commands are running, open `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.
